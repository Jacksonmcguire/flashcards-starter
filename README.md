## Abstract
* This project allows a user to run through a deck of flashcards and attempt to answer the cards question correctly. If the user receives a score of under 90% for the round, they will be forced to restart that round until a score of at least 90% is met.  

![Finishing the round](/src/finish-round.gif "Score of 90% or better")
![Not finishing the round due to score](/src/wont-finish-round.gif "Score below 90%")
